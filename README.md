# LeetCode Marathon: A Journey of Problem Solving

## Introduction

> Only when having mastered the basic data structures and algorithms can you solve complex problems easily.

This repository is divided into three parts:

- The first part is a summary of data structures and algorithms.

- The second part is the solutions to classic problems on Leetcode, including the idea thinkings, key points and code implementations.

- The third part is future planning on content that will be learned to improve programming knowledge.

## Usage Instructions

The algorithms mainly include:

- Basic skills: Divide-and-Conquer; Binary; Greedy
- Sorting algorithms: Quicksort; Merge Sort; Counting Sort;
- Searching algorithms: Backtracking; Recursion; Depth-First-Search (DFS); Breath-First-Search (BFS); Binary Search Tree; etc.
- Graph theory: Shortest Path Problems; Minimal Spanning Tree
- Dynamic Programming: Knapsack Problems; Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Problem

The data structures mainly include:

- Array and linked list: Singly/Doubly-Linked List
- Stack and queue
- Hash table
- Heap: Min-Max Heap
- Tree and Graph: Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA); Disjoint-Set
- String: Prefix Tree (Trie); Suffix Tree
